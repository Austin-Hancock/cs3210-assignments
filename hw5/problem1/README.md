# HW5 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

You are on a team with Bob and while you were out sick, he thought it'd be fun to volunteer your team to implement simple text-based streaming for the `Shape` class hierarchy from [`lab6`](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-labs/tree/master/lab6/1%20-%20class%20hierarchies). As usual, when it came to actually doing the work, Bob quickly gave up and left it to you to finish the assignment. 

Copy the code from [`lab6`](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-labs/tree/master/lab6/1%20-%20class%20hierarchies) into this repo and modify/complete it to make Bob's  `main.cpp` (provided in this repo) compile, run, and write on disk two text files that match the files provided in the `expected` folder. Do not modify Bob's `main.cpp`. 

Use C++ abstraction mechanisms to avoid/eliminate copy & paste (including existing copy & paste in `lab6` source code).
